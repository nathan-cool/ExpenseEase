## User Experience (UX)

### User stories :
- As a user, I want to be able to easily register and log in, so that I can manage my expenses securely.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Authentication System

- **Registration System**: Allows users to create a new account by providing their name, email, and password. The registration view splits the user's name into first and last names, validates the provided information, and if valid, sends a verification email to activate the account.
- **Login System**: Users can log in to their account using their email and password. The system checks if the account is active and has correct credentials before granting access.
- **Logout System**: Logged-in users can log out of their account, which redirects them to the login page with a success message.
- **Google OAuth Integration**: Users have the option to authenticate using Google, simplifying the login process without the need for a password.
- **Email Validation**: Validates emails in real-time during registration to ensure they are not already in use and follow the correct format.
- **Password Validation**: Checks password strength to ensure it meets the required criteria for security.
- **Account Verification**: After registration, users receive an email with a link to verify their account, ensuring the email address belongs to them.
